Work in progress

This is my own take on a Nextjs starter repo.

I'm building a lot of things as a side project. I'm tired of doing the same thing over and over again.

This would be a full-stack Nextjs repo.

What we have here:

- Nextjs 14 with App Router
- Drizzle ORM for Postrges
- Tanstack React Query
- Basic POST and GET endpoint (todo)
- Hooks for data fetching (todo)

Maybe I'll add these in the future:

- Auth
- Payment

## How to start

- Clone the project
- pnpm i
- pnpm dev
- Mess around
